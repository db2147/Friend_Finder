Express js handles the routing for us along with body parser and path dependencies. &nbsp;The body parser is considered middleware. &nbsp;It parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before the handlers.&nbsp; Express provides small tooling for HTTP servers which makes it ideal for our website application when navigating.

Here is an example of a get request in our api-routes file:<br><br>We use the get function routing to our variable friends located in our friends.js directory. &nbsp;Inside the function there is a request and a response (function(req,res). &nbsp;We console.log the friendsData variable and json turns this object into a string for us to use in our application.
